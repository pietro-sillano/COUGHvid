# Dataset

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that 67.7% of COVID-19 patients exhibit a “dry cough,” which may be audibly different from
coughs caused by other pathologies. Such cough sounds analysis has proven successful in diagnosing respiratory conditions like pertussis,
asthma, and pneumonia. 
We employ the COUGHVID database [1], which is an extensive dataset of COVID-19  cough sounds from around the world, partially validated by expert pulmonologists.
